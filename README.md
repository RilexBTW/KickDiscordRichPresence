## How to create your discord app
[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications "Discord Developer Portal")
1). Go to the Discord Dev Portal and create a new application. 
2).  Whatever you name it will be what people see on the side bar (So if you name it Kick.com/URL, it will say "**Playing Kick.com/URL**")
3). Click on Rich Presence and supply the image. If you would like to use the logo I used, you can download it [here](https://github.com/RilexBTW/KickDiscordRichPresence/raw/main/logo.png "here"). Do not rename the image, unless you change what it is named in the code aswell.
4). Copy the application ID that you are given on your applications homepage and paste that in the client_id section of the python script. 
5). You can now run the script manually whenever you go live.
